# Biography

I am a doctral student of physics at the univ. of Tokyo. My interests include particle physics, muon, anomalous magnetic moment, accleralator.
I am working now as a member of J-PARC muon g-2/EDM experiment. My work is to develop spin rotator in low energy acceleration of muon. If you are intersted in our works, please contact us.
